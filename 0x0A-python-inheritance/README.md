		0x0A Python - Inheritance üêç
At the end of this project, I was able to solve these questions:

What is a superclass, baseclass or parentclass
What is a subclass
How to list all attributes and methods of a class or instance
When can an instance have new attributes
How to inherit class from another
How to define a class with multiple base classes
What is the default class every class inherit from
How to override a method or attribute inherited from the base class
Which attributes or methods are available by heritage to subclasses
What is the purpose of inheritance
What are, when and how to use isinstance, issubclass, type and super built-in functions
				Tasks ‚úîÔ∏è
